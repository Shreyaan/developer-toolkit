# The Modern Developer's Toolkit üöÄ

> **A curated collection of powerful tools, services, and libraries for building modern applications.**

This repository contains a curated list of powerful tools, services, and libraries for building modern applications.

The list is managed via the `toolsData.json` file in this repository. The live site and this README are automatically updated when changes are merged into the `master` branch.

**Goal is to have a list of tools that are useful for building modern applications. Please feel free to contribute to the list as I know for the fact that I have missed out on a lot of tools.**

I have tried to categorize the tools as best as I can.

**Looking forward to your contributions! üòÑüöÄ**
